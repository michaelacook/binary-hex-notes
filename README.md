# readme

This is a set of notes based on the YouTube video [Binary & Hexadecimal Demystified - NESHacker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8eKbrcBYPM&list=PLgvDB6LWam2VkdnDwpVz4F9B_jJtEcElg&index=1&ab_channel=NesHacker). The content mostly summarizes the video. Special thanks to Ryan, the creator of the NESHacker channel for making a very useful intro to binary and hexadecimal numbers.
